# ApiBridge

*This gem is no longer supported.*

The functionality of this gem is now built into the Orchid rails engine ([link](https://github.com/CDRH/orchid)). This gem will remain available for legacy installs of orchid 2.1.0 and below but should not be used for new projects.

The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) has marked up many documents with TEI, Dublin Core, VRA, and other encoding standards. These documents are indexed into an API. This gem reduces repeating logic when powering sites with the API's information.
