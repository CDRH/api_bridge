# ApiBridge

The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) has marked up many documents with TEI, Dublin Core, VRA, and other encoding standards. These documents are indexed into an API. This gem reduces repeating logic when powering sites with the API's information.

**ApiBridge Documentation can be found [in our documentation repository](https://github.com/CDRH/sneezewort/blob/master/docs/api_bridge/README.md)**

**Documentation for entire publishing system can be found here: ([https://github.com/CDRH/sneezewort](https://github.com/CDRH/sneezewort))**
